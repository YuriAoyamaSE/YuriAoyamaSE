### A little about myself üëÄ 
<p align="justify"> I am what they call a multipotential person and it took me a while to find my professional purpose. But I found it. In early 2022 I started a career transition to technology. I studied programming logic and some languages (JS, CSS, HTML, Java), deciding to focus on Python.</p>
<p align="justify">My Python journey started with /C√≥digo[S], a python bootcamp promoted by <a href="https://www.stone.com.br/">Stone</a> and <a href="https://howedu.com.br/">How</a>. With over nine thousand entries, only 214 selected for the bootcamp that lasted twenty-three weeks, I finished in the top 16 for a final - a Hackathon. Unfortunately, I didn't win the hackathon, but it was an amazing experience (which I'd rather not repeat. Oh... those three wonderful/hellish days... without sleeping or eating right).</p>
<p align="justify">This event helped me to realize that I made a decision that I will not regret, even though I still have a long way to go.</p>


### A little more about myself <img align="center" alt="d8-icon" height="30" width="30" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/04/16/19/39/d20-7136921_960_720.png">
<p align="justify"> Apparently, I've always been a creative person who likes to analyze/solve problems. No wonder I ended up learning how to play RPG (and I keep playing - let's roll dice!). And I'm a very nice DM to my players (although some disagree on this).</p>
<p align="justify">I was always lazy at school. I got high grades because I paid close attention in class (so I wouldn't have to study at home). Ironically, today I really enjoy reading and studying regularly. </p>
<p align="justify">And... I have three cats. üê±</p> 


### And now what? <img align="center" alt="d8-icon" height="30" width="40" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/04/03/11/55/snake-312561_960_720.png">
<p align="justify"> <img align="right" alt="d8-icon" height="100" width="100" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/05/09/13/33/laptop-2298286_960_720.png"> Every day is a growth. I don't intend to stop studying and improve my skills, regardless of the moment of my career. </p>


### My projetcs <img align="center" alt="d8-icon" height="30" width="40" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/04/01/17/39/folder-23690_960_720.png">
<p align="justify"> I started using github for studies, that's why it has several of my notebooks. But I will always be updating and highlighting my projects/portfolio. 
(Ps.: not all will be in English, but I intend to adapt little by little when possible.)</p>
